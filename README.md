Fuel Efficiency Optimization: A Predictive Analysis for Energy-Efficient Car Design
Project Overview
This project aims to help a car manufacturer design more fuel-efficient vehicles by analyzing vehicle attributes and their impact on gas mileage (miles per gallon or MPG). The analysis identifies the key factors that contribute to fuel efficiency, guiding the manufacturer in prioritizing design elements for future models.


Problem Statement
With increasing demand for energy-efficient cars, this project explores attributes influencing MPG to support a major car manufacturer struggling with sales. By identifying these factors, the manufacturer can design and produce more fuel-efficient vehicles, meeting consumer expectations and staying competitive.

Data
The dataset contains several vehicle attributes:

MPG: Miles Per Gallon, indicating fuel efficiency
Cylinders: Number of cylinders in the engine
Displacement: Engine size
Horsepower: Engine power
Weight: Vehicle weight
Acceleration: Time to reach 100 MPH
Model Year: Year of manufacture
US Made: Origin indicator
Tasks
Task 1: Data Cleansing
Clean the data for quality modeling, including handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring consistency in data types. Detailed explanations of the cleansing decisions are included in the code.

Task 2: Linear Regression Model
A linear regression model is built to predict MPG based on vehicle attributes. The most significant features are analyzed to recommend design priorities for improving fuel efficiency.

Task 3: Feature Selection
Using forward and backward selection algorithms, we refine the model to identify the most impactful features. Model metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are compared with the initial linear regression model to assess improvements.

Task 4: Conclusions
Summarize key findings and prioritize attributes that can enhance fuel efficiency in car design. Recommendations are made on how to incorporate these insights into upcoming developments, referencing industry practices and competitor insights where applicable.

Results
Top Attributes for Fuel Efficiency: Analyzed and ranked based on feature importance and model performance.
Comparison of Models: Metrics such as MSE and AIC show the impact of feature selection on model accuracy.
